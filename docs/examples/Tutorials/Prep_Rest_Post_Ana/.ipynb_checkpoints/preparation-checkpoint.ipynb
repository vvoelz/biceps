    "First we need to perform conformational clustering on our MD simulations data. In this case, 100 metastable states are clustered. Now we need to prepare prior knowledge we learned from computational simulations. Normally, we used potential energy for each metastable state. In the [original work](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcc.23738), Zhou et al did Quantum Mechanical (QM) calculations to refine each state and B3LYP energy was used as priors in BICePs calculation. Instructions of QM calculations are beyond the scope of this tutorial. Alternatively, we can estimate the potential energy using U = -ln(P) where P is the normalized population for each state. We also have built-in functions ([toolbox](https://biceps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#toolbox)) to conduct this conversion. You can find tutorials using functions in `toolbox.py` [here](https://biceps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Tools/toolbox.html).   \n"

    "To compare simulated conformational ensembles to experimental NOE measurements, we normally computed $<r^{-6}>^{-1/6}$. For convenience in this tutorial, we assume the cluster center of each state is representative enough and simply compute pairwise distances for the cluster center conformation. In practice, we still recommend users to compute ensemble-averaged distance."

    "### Conclusion###\n",
    "In this tutorial, we briefly showed how to use [Preparation](https://biceps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#preparation) class to prepare input files for BICePs using precomputed experimental observables. As of 2019, BICePs supports the following observables: NOE, J couplings, Chemical Shifts, Protection Factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we showed how to deal with NOE and J couplings (non-natural amino acids). \n",
    "\n",
    "For J couplings for natural amino acids, please check this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical shifts can be computed using different algorithm. We recommend to use [Shiftx2](http://www.shiftx2.ca) which is also available in MDTraj library.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Protection factors is a special observables which asks for extra work. We provide a [separate tutorial](https://biceps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Tutorials/Prep_Rest_Post_Ana/protectionfactors.html) that includes protection factors in BICePs sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the input files are ready, we can move on to [Restraint](https://biceps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Tutorials/Prep_Rest_Post_Ana/Restraint.html), where we construct a conformational ensemble. \n"
